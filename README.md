AltaeraAI is a Termux wrapper that packages KoboldCpp and Kobold Lite UI for native usage on Android devices.

The main premise of it is to automate AI Inference using a smartphone, with the help of well-chosen, open tools. This allows you for instant access to Artificial Intelligence - whether that be companionship, assistance or just text generation. At the same time, you maintain 100% privacy over your stories - you own the software due to the nature of locality.

Installation:

- Paste in Termux:
   curl -o install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/latestissue/altaera-packages.github.io/main/altaera-v2/install && chmod +x install && ./install


Launching & Updating:

- Open Termux, type in “ae” – you will be welcomed with the MENU screen.

The “Start AltaeraAI” button will forward you to a browser with deployed UI.
