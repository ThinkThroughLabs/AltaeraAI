AltaeraAI is a Termux wrapper that packages KoboldCpp and Kobold Lite UI for native usage on Android devices.

The main premise of it is to automate AI Inference using a smartphone, with the help of well-chosen, Open-Source tools and software. This allows you for instant access to Artificial Intelligence - whether that be companionship, assistance or just text generation. At the same time, you maintain 100% privacy over your stories - you own the software due to the nature of locality.

AltaeraAI works as a platform in order to provide easy instructions and support for AI deployment on Android devices with the use of Termux.
