Recent changes:

    * v6.1.0 - partially revamped UI, as part of a bigger code rebuild and refactoring; changed theme, added animations, improved functionalities, fixed bugs, added the ability to stop KoboldCpp inference by pressing "q"
    * added RWKV-G1 and Gemma-3 weights to the list of models
    * v6.0.6 - updated the pre-packaged KoboldCpp to v1.91
    * v6.0.5 - updated the pre-packaged KoboldCpp to v1.90.2
    * v6.0.4 - updated the pre-packaged KoboldCpp to v1.89
    * v6.0.3 - fixed the link to RWKV7-Goose-World3-2.9B
    * v6.0.2 - updated the pre-packaged KoboldCpp to experimental/v1.88 â€” the reason being that the experimental branch included a fix for RWKV related to a broken recurrent cache component in upstream LlamaCpp
